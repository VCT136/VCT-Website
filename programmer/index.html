            <h1>Vincent, Programmer</h1>
            <p>
                <b>Hello!</b> I'm Vincent, a student of Communication and Multimedia design with a major in Game Design and a political activist in Groningen, the Netherlands. My motto is <i>"Question everything!"</i>.<br>
                <br>
                Since I was 13 years old I have had a fascination for computer code, starting to write some simple scripts at the time, then learning javascript and doing two internships in IT.<br>
                Programming more and more small games and apps is part of what brought me to choose my study and seeing its products still sometimes seems beautifully magical to me.<br>
                <br>
                As it is a passion of mine I want to keep myself involved with professional software / game development in the future, indirectly at the very least :)

        <h1>What Can I Do?</h1>
        <p>
            I can program apps and games using JavaScript, Python, Unity/C#, and some other software.<br>
            I am a quick learner and open to acquiring more programming expertise as well.<br>
            <br>
            I have developed a multitude of small games, some of which (Unity 3D group projects from my study programme) support virtual reality hardware.<br>
            <br>
            During my internship at Fielmann Ventures I developed a MEAN-stack based database solution, I made a simple encryption interface when I was 16 and in 2019 I created a Discord bot for Volt Europa.

    <article class="card">
        <h1>In General</h1>
        <p>
            Over many years I have acquired various programming skills which I have made use of in software- and game-development.<br>
            <br>
            Since 2019 I am studying Communication & Multimedia Design with a major in Game Design. During these studies I have done programming work on many projects, some of which I have highlighted below.

        <h1>GameMaker Studio games</h1>
        <p>
            Using the engine GameMaker Studio's dedicated programming language GML I have done programming work on the games Sail Sale and <a href="/games/coinconquest/">Coin Conquest</a>.<br>
            <img src="/res/sailsale_screenshot.jpg" alt="screenshot of Sail Sale" /><img src="/res/coinconquest.jpg" alt="screenshot of Coin Conquest" />

        <h1>VRquaponics</h1>
        <p>
            With <a href="/games/vrquaponics/">VRquaponics</a> I have taken my first step into developing for virtual reality.<br>
            <img src="/res/vrquaponics_screenshot.jpg" alt="screenshot of VRquaponics" /><br>
            I also learnt a lot of the basics of the Unity 3D editor and C# working on it. Together with my teammate Sten-Erik I created all the interactive features of this aquaponic farming simulation, such as the item dispensers and growth simulation.

        <h1>Stellar Transporter</h1>
        <p>
            I made <a href="/games/stellartransporter/">Stellar Transporter</a>, a 2D space cargo trading game, using the JavaScript game framework Phaser.<br>
            <img src="/res/stellarTransporter.jpg" alt="screenshot of Stellar Transporter" /><br>
            In programming the game I learnt to use the Phaser framework and advanced my JavaScript knowledge.<br>
            <br>
            I also made use of the integrated physics engine to enhance the game's believable feeling of space and object within it.
