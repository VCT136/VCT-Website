            <h1>Vincent, Programmer</h1>
            <p>
                <b>Hello!</b> I'm Vincent, a student of Communication and Multimedia design with a major in Game Design and a political activist in Groningen, the Netherlands. My motto is <i>"Question everything!"</i>.<br>
                <br>
                Since I was 13 years old I have had a fascination for computer code, starting to write some simple scripts at the time, then learning javascript and doing two internships in IT.<br>
                Programming more and more small games and apps is part of what brought me to choose my study and seeing its products still sometimes seems beautifully magical to me.<br>
                <br>
                As it is a passion of mine I want to keep myself involved with professional software / game development in the future, indirectly at the very least :)

        <h1>What Can I Do?</h1>
        <p>
            I can program apps and games using JavaScript, Python, Unity/C#, and some other software.<br>
            I am a quick learner and open to acquiring more programming expertise as well.<br>
            <br>
            I have developed a multitude of small games, some of which (Unity 3D group projects from my study programme) support virtual reality hardware.

    <article class="card">
        <h1>In General</h1>
        <p>
            My experience coordinating teams stems largely from my involvement in several project groups during my studies.<br>
            <br>
            At no point so far have I had the opportunity to focus primarily on management at a project, since I was also bringing myself in in another role (usually the main game programmer) requiring significant commitment.<br>
            <br>
            I have found myself enjoying team management and am open and looking forward to experiencing more of it, hopefully boosting more teams to successful results.
