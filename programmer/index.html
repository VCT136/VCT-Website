            <h1>Vincent, Programmer</h1>
            <p>
                <b>Hello!</b> I'm Vincent, a student of Communication and Multimedia design with a major in Game Design and a political activist in Groningen, the Netherlands. My motto is <i>"Question everything!"</i>.<br>
                <br>
                Since I was 13 years old I have had a fascination for computer code, starting to write some simple scripts at the time, then learning javascript and doing two internships in IT.<br>
                Programming more and more small games and apps is part of what brought me to choose my study and seeing its products still sometimes seems beautifully magical to me.<br>
                <br>
                As it is a passion of mine I want to keep myself involved with professional software / game development in the future, indirectly at the very least :)

        <h1>What Can I Do?</h1>
        <p>
            I can program apps and games using JavaScript, Python, Unity/C#, and some other software.<br>
            I am a quick learner and open to acquiring more programming expertise as well.<br>
            <br>
            I have developed a multitude of small games, some of which (Unity 3D group projects from my study programme) support virtual reality hardware.<br>
            <br>
            During my internship at Fielmann Ventures I developed a MEAN-stack based database solution, I made a simple encryption interface when I was 16 and in 2019 I created a Discord bot for Volt Europa.
