            <b>Description</b><br>
            <br>
            Coin Conquest is a digital, casino style game, based on the minigame "Fruit Cahoots" from the Mario Party game series by Nintendo.<br>
            <br>
            It was developed using <a href="https://www.yoyogames.com/gamemaker" target="_blank">GameMaker Studio by YoYo Games</a> as part of my Game Design studies at the Hanze University of Applied Sciences Groningen.<br>
            <br>
            Coin Conquest runs on Windows PCs and tablets, and is playable using a keyboard and mouse, only a mouse, or a touchscreen.

            <b>Vınсenт's Thoughts</b><br>
            <br>
            In this project I learned to code in the engine specific "GameMaker Language" and was intrigued by some of the convenient features it offers. I also found that the game, through its visual design, slight animations and sound design is rather effectively addicting despite its minimalist content, especially when tested on tablets.
