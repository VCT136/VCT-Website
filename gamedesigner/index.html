            <h1>Game Designer</h1>
            <p>
                For all of my life, as far as I can remember, I have loved games and also come up with my own ones.<br>
                <br>
                Early on I made my own hand-drawn trading card games inspired by Pokémon and similar card games, in Wario Ware D.I.Y. I created dozens of custom microgames and I used Scratch to make 2D games in a building block style visual programming language.<br>
                <br>
                When I discovered that making games is an option to aim for as a career, I knew I wanted to be involved with making games professionally in the future.<br>
                Staying on that path, I kept making games and chose the major Game Design for my study.

        <h1>What Can I Do?</h1>
        <p>
            I can come up with ideas and suggestions for games quickly, evaluate and communicate them.<br>
            <br>
            I have learnt ways to document and report on game design. Good logical thinking and argumentative ability help me with that.<br>
            <br>
            In my Game Design I have led and participated in many group projects developing games, through which I have acquired more and more relevant skills for game design work.<br>
            <br>
            I can improve games and make new ones. Both on my own or with a team, which I can both manage and/or take part in.

    <article class="card">
        <h1>In General</h1>
        <p>
            I made a lot of small games of various kinds: card games, board games, video games, and the latter of numerous genres.<br>
            <br>
            Logically, the older I got, the more experience I acquired, and the better the games got.<br>
            <br>
            Below, I showcase some of the games I worked on where I was heavily involved in the game design or made them on my own.

    <article class="card" id="tait">
        <h1>TAIT</h1>
        <p>
            As the first game I made in my studies, I chose to make use of the university's makerspace and used wood as the game's material.<br>
            <img src="/res/tait_bg.jpg" alt="photo of TAIT" /><br>
            After creating and testing a paper prototype of a rotation- and secrecy-based card game, I designed the <a href="/games/tait/">TAIT</a> cards and tokens in Figma and had them laser-cut.<br>
            <br>
            After several more instances of testing and adjustments to the game rules it arrived at a state in which it was deemed fun and innovative by almost everyone who played it.

    <article class="card" id="vrgora">
        <h1>VRgora</h1>
        <p>
            With <a href="/games/vrgora/">VRgora</a> we made a VR prototype of a serious game concept we developed to help agoraphobic people and those close to them deal with the condition.<br>
            <img src="/res/vrgora_screenshot.png" alt="screenshot of VRgora" /><br>
            People with specific types of agoraphobia, which are (or are similar to) the one, where they are afraid of crowded or large, open places shall learn motivational strategies through the game, by <i>"coaching" the game's protagonist</i> to get through their struggles with the condition.<br>
            <br>
            Unlike VR-experiences for exposure therapy, our therapeutical approach with the game is therefore one of <i>coach to be coached</i>.<br>
            <br>
            The outside perspective of intuitively adjustable distance provided in the VR prototype allows agoraphobic players to feel comfortable with the game even when it depicts situations they would be afraid of if immersed in them.
