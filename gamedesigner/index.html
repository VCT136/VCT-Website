            <p>
                <b>Hello!</b> I'm Vincent, a student of Communication and Multimedia design with a major in Game Design and a political activist in Groningen, the Netherlands. My motto is <i>"Question everything!"</i>.<br>
                <br>
                For all of my life, as far as I can remember, I have loved games and also come up with my own ones.

        <h1>What Can I Do?</h1>
        <p>
            I can come up with ideas and suggestions for games quickly, evaluate and communicate them.<br>
            <br>
            I have learnt ways to document and report on game design. Good logical thinking and argumentative ability help me with that.<br>
            <br>
            In my Game Design I have led and participated in many group projects developing games, through which I have acquired more and more relevant skills for game design work.<br>
            <br>
            I can improve games and make new ones. Both on my own or with a team, which I can both manage and/or take part in.

    <article class="card">
        <h1>In General</h1>
        <p>
            My experience coordinating teams stems largely from my involvement in several project groups during my studies.<br>
            <br>
            At no point so far have I had the opportunity to focus primarily on management at a project, since I was also bringing myself in in another role (usually the main game programmer) requiring significant commitment.<br>
            <br>
            I have found myself enjoying team management and am open and looking forward to experiencing more of it, hopefully boosting more teams to successful results.

        <h1>TAIT</h1>
        <p>
            As the first game I made in my studies, I chose to make use of the university's makerspace and used wood as the game's material.<br>
            <img src="/res/tait_bg.jpg" alt="photo of TAIT" /><br>
            After creating and testing a paper prototype of a rotation- and secrecy-based card game, I designed the <a href="/games/tait/">TAIT</a> cards and tokens in Figma and had them laser-cut.<br>
