        <h1>Unexpected beginning</h1>
        <p>
            This article shall be about the Sail Sale project and how I got interested in project management by analyzing what went wrong there.<br/>
            I first got thrown into project management at the start of my studies, was not prepared for the group dynamics and did not even expect to take up responsibilities. <br/>
            My first two group projects were plagued with problems mostly arising from poor communication and planning. <br/>

        <h1>First managed project</h1>
        <p>
            This article shall be about how I managed the VRquaponics project using Trello, and how our collaboration and communication worked significantly better in this one. <br/>

        <h1>Challenging second project</h1>
        <p>
            In this article I want to address on the one hand how I improved on the learnings from the previous projects, but also about the experience of working with a group of obvious introverts as the only extrovert in it.<br/>
            It may also be a good idea to talk about Agile here... <br/>
