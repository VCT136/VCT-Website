            <h1>Vincent, Team Coordinator</h1>
            <p>
                <b>Hello!</b> I'm Vincent, a student of Communication and Multimedia design with a major in Game Design and a political activist in Groningen, the Netherlands. My motto is <i>"Question everything!"</i>.<br>
                <br>
                Throughout my study I have taken part in and managed many group projects, finding not only an interest and joy in coordinating the team, but also discovering ways to improve our cooperation each iteration.

        <h1>What Can I Do?</h1>
        <p>
            I can coordinate task assignments and manage calls and meetings for teams of varying size. I facilitate group decision making, help reaching compromises and bring many ideas into the discussion.<br>
            <br>
            Of special importance to me is that all team members can voice their opinion on a matter and won't shy away from doing so. To ensure no "silent opposition" to a decision arises I value to check the standpoints of all parties in individual talks.<br>
            <br>
            Core values of my team work ethic are efficiency and democracy, which are reflected in the way I organize meetings and professional communication.<br>
            <br>
            Projects I can take on should fit an area of special interest for me, so that I can make valuable contributions using my subject knowledge, better understand contexts and be passionate about the project.<br>
            These areas of interest for me are: <i>games (video-, card-, and boardgames), convenience software, future technology, politics, history, sci-fi, languages and simulation</i>

        <h1>Unexpected beginning</h1>
        <p>
            When I started my Communication and Multimedia Design studies in 2019 I had no expectation to get heavily involved with management aspects of our project work at all. As it turned out however, I seemed to have a natural tendency to be the one leading our group discussions towards common goals, always looking to progress the project to its next foreseeable state.<br>
            <br>
            The first two group projects I got involved with, while fulfilling their educational purpose, didn't go smoothly. I did however, take away several key learnings regarding team coordination from them.<br>
            <img src="/res/sailsale_screenshot.jpg" alt="a screenshot of Sail Sale" />
            For the development of the game "Sail Sale", of which the screenshot on the left is taken, I first picked up a leading role in our group meetings, steering the project to progress by facilitating informed, democratic decision making.<br>
            <br>
            In this process I asked for input on game design decisions in general, but did not think of asking everyone for their opinion explicitly.<br>
            That doing so would have been a good idea, since I found out that a group member disagreed with a fundamental game design decision (which at that point was fixed) three weeks into development. They were not happy to work on the project because of that and only participated when prompted.<br>
            <br>
            With better communication that could have been avoided, which is why I'm doing my best to prevent such situations in all my following projects - so far with success!

            This article shall be about how I managed the VRquaponics project using Trello, and how our collaboration and communication worked significantly better in this one. <br/>

        <h1>Challenging second project</h1>
        <p>
            In this article I want to address on the one hand how I improved on the learnings from the previous projects, but also about the experience of working with a group of obvious introverts as the only extrovert in it.<br/>
            It may also be a good idea to talk about Agile here... <br/>
