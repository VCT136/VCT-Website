            This is a fun and innovative casual card game for friends and families.<br/>
            <br/>
            All players get two cards, and try to rotate their opponents' cards a certain way, to defeat them. Meanwhile, they need to try securing their own cards, keeping their orientation secret. The players try remembering the cards that were shown.<br/>
            The main mechanics of the game are spying and attacking, used to have a look at, rotate and eventually defeat the opponents' cards.<br/>
            <br/>
            It was developed in the context of my Game Design studies and I wrote a report about its design, which is available <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GTY6C_QruDj2BKqeXT63E0MJJqwHSA7d/view" target="_blank">here</a>.
