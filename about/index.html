            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>
                My name is Vincent and I am following the Game Design major of my university's Communication and Multimedia Design study programme in the Netherlands.<br/>
                <br/>
                I enjoy the awesome products coming from the games industry, see an interesting variety of tasks in it, love the achievement of putting things together and seeing them work and it makes me happy to see people enjoy what I made.
                Critical thinking, initiative, a focus on efficiency and team leadership are skills that contribute to my competence as a game designer.<br/>
                Working on Game Design projects in my study programme, I have found to mainly enjoy doing a mixture or programming and design work, as well as team management.<br/>
                <br>
                My favorite video games are Civilization, Europa Universalis, Rocket League, Battlefield, Stellaris, Just Cause, Space Engineers and FlatOut. Elements of these frequently inspire me.<br/>
                Apart from games, my interests lie in the fields of history, politics, geography, linguistics and arts. As a member of student organization SIB (Dutch United Nations Student Association) I can follow many interesting lectures and events on such topics.
                Additionally, I am an active member of the first pan-European political party Volt, for which I manage the official merchandise shop, help manage the Discord server, design materials, and support the local team.
