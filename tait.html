        <p>
            This is a fun and innovative casual card game for friends and families.<br>
            It was developed in the context of my game design studies.<br>
            <br>
            All players get two cards, and try to rotate their opponents' cards a certain way, to defeat them. Meanwhile, they need to try securing their own cards, keeping their orientation secret. The players try remembering the cards that were shown.<br>
            <br>
            The main mechanics of the game are spying and attacking, used to have a look at, rotate and eventually defeat the opponents' cards.
