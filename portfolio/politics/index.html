        <h1>My Political Activity</h1>
        <div>
            <img src="/res/volt/voltinnl.jpg" alt="rally of Volt Europa in the Netherlands, 2019" />
            I am active for the pan-European movement and political party Volt Europa, which stands on a common platform for its pragmatic and progressive values all over Europe.<br>
            <br>
            This is because I believe, that the great challenges of our time could much easier be conquered in cooperation instead of using isolated efforts by small, independent nations. I also want to see Europe's position on the world stage strengthened through greater cohesion, in order to have the union become an effective force for democracy and human rights globally.<br>
            <br> 
            I joined Volt in May of 2019 and have taken up some responsibilities within the party since January 2020, having done voluntary work as Volt Europa's Discord Lead, a member of Volt Nederland's design team and local Communications Lead of Volt Groningen, currently occupying the function of Volt Europa's Merchandise Lead.

            Who should I vote for? All the parties are bad in a way… A year ago I was still in high school and that is what I was wondering about. The 2019 European Parliamentary elections were the first real elections I was allowed to participate in, and while I was happy to finally get a voice in our political system, the variety of options seemed rather poor to me.<br>
            <br>
            I appreciated the foreign policy of the French government party LREM for example, and the internal political efforts of the previous Finnish government party. But on the one hand one doesn't get to vote on individual policy areas, and on the other hand I couldn't vote for either of those parties, because they aren't registered in Germany.<br>
            I had previously been arguing in my high school politics classes, that it'd be enormously advantageous to improve on the European Union and further integrate its member states, to become a more than just noteworthy powerhouse on the world stage, gaining the ability to stand up to the other world powers: Russia, India, China and the United States.<br>
            Since none of the major parties in Germany really seemed to think of European integration as a priority, I intended to waste my vote on the satirical party, until only few weeks before the election, I heard about Volt Europa: a new, pan-European political party focussing on pragmatic talking-points with substantiated reasoning and progressive development. In that party I had found my "political home" (by which I don't mean that I agree with everything Volt says).<br>
            I joined them, helping in the last part of the campaign and it worked out, as Volt managed to get into the European parliament the first time the party ever participated in an election.<br>
            <br> 
            I also got involved with the party's Discord server, becoming a moderator and restructuring various aspects of it. In August that year I moved to Groningen and took more responsibility, becoming the de-facto manager of the server.<br>
            At the beginning of the new year 2020, I was officially promoted to the position of "EUR Discord Lead". I began building a team of moderators and other helpers for the server, and through our various efforts we have now become the second largest Discord server of a political party (only behind the US Republican Party).<br>
            <br>
            Through this involvement I have acquired skills in content moderation, team leadership, setting guidelines and content policy decisions, as well as social media marketing. The latter used to be a thing I was actually afraid of trying before, and it is still far from my favorite occupation, but I can say that I have gotten noticeably better at online communication than before. No longer am I only communicating the bare minimum, and no longer am I  so hesitant  to post things, just because I used to be afraid they might not be perfect.<br>
            <br>
            Did I mention I began studying game design during that period of time as well? No? Well, I did.<br>
            As a game designer one of the key competences that lead to success is the ability to cooperate with different people and structure things for a team without imposing unpopular decisions on others.<br>
            During my studies I often have to work in cooperation with other students, and that is also unlikely to be any different when I will eventually work at a company.<br>
            <br>
            Many skills useful to leading a team I learnt at Volt and transferred into my study groups.<br>
            Additionally I learnt some aspects of design theory and vector graphics while working with the design team of Volt Nederland.<br>
            <br>
            And that is how I gained game design skills by becoming involved with a political party.
