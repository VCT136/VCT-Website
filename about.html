        <h2>My Story</h2>
        <img src="res/2020decemeberme.jpg" alt="a photo of me from December 2020" />
        <p>
            I am Vınсеnт, also known by my shortcut / pseudonym VCT on many online platforms.<br>
            <br>
            Game Design is what I study, a thing I've liked to do for many years, and which has become the profession I pursue since I found out that it is an actual job.<br>
            To become better at making games, learn more useful competences to work in the games industry, make contacts and improve my communication and marketing skills I moved from my home town Hamburg to Groningen to study at the Hanzehogeschool Groningen.<br>
            <br>
            I enjoy the awesome products coming from the games industry, see an interesting variety of tasks in it, love the achievement of putting things together and seeing them work and it makes me happy to see people enjoy what I made.<br>
            Critical thinking, initiative, a focus on efficiency and team leadership are skills that contribute to my competence as a game designer.<br>
            Would you like to find out how I improved some relevant skills by getting involved with politics? Check out my text about that. It's linked below.
