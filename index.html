                Game Designer / Developer
            </h1>
            <p>
                Welcome to my portfolio website! My name is Vincent and I make games. After finishing my Game Design studies in 2023 I have developed and published my strategy game Konkwest, and while I keep supporting the game with patches and content, I am looking for the next step in my career. <br>
                <br>
                Games and computer technology have been my passion for as long as I can remember. It started when I collected and hand-crafted trading cards in school, and I have therefore styled this website in reference to my fondness of card games. Below you can choose a card to continue on to either an overview of my projects or my resumé page.
