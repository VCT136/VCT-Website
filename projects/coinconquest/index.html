            <h2>Vincent's Thoughts</h2>
            <p>
                In this project I learned to code in the engine specific "GameMaker Language" and was intrigued by some of the convenient features it offers. I also found that the game, through its visual design, slight animations and sound design is rather effectively addicting despite its minimalist content, especially when tested on tablets.
