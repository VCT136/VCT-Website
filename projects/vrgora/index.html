                        The main character walks through the street and stop when they are frightened. The player encourages them to move on by providing helpful messages.

            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>
                VRgora (virtual reality agora) is a VR prototype for a concept of an AR app designed to improve the lives of people with agoraphobia.<br/>
                <br>
                The player observes a miniature environment, which a character traverses on their way to their goal. That character, named Sam, is agoraphobic and the player must choose the right messages to motivate him to overcome his fear and proceed walking, balancing between avoidance, engagement and exposure-induced panic.<br>
                <br>
                The game is based on the principle that by coaching another person, one also indirectly coaches themselves, since both parties receive the coach's motivational messaging.
