            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>
                It is 1926: The Holy Roman Emperor has died. It is therefore time for a new Emperor to be elected. To gain votes in the Imperial Election, the candidates are touring the realm in their impressive, highly decorated airships. You are those candidates. Become the new Emperor!<br/>
                <br/>
                Kaiserzeit 1926 (K26 for short) is an alternate history board game. Its title is German and translates to "1926: The Era of the Emperor".<br/>
                <br/>
                Its game rules and cards are written in German language, and I have so far not gotten to translating everything about this game.<br/>
                Check out the <a href="k26">Kaiserzeit 1926 web page</a> for some more English language information, though.<br/>
                If you speak German and want to read more about the alternate history of the game's setting, you can do so <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zwjaHJFJTsQi23cjP_xxF-DTqfweKuflY2ea37S3cJ8">here</a>.
