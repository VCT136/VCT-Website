			<h1>Complete Timeline</h1>
			<p>
				It is 1926: The Holy Roman Emperor has died. It is therefore time for a new Emperor to be elected. To gain votes in the Imperial Election, the candidates are touring the realm in their impressive, highly decorated airships. This is how history played out, to get to this point:
			</p>
			<h2>1432: The Fate of the Netherlands</h2>
			<p>
				Burgundy lost the battle of Brouwershaven, and subsequently the hook and cod wars. Therefore the local rulers gain more relevance again in the Netherlands, while Burgundy slowly loses all of its posessions in the Netherlands until 1460.
			</p>
			<div class="popupbox">
				<i>Why?</i><br><br>
				In the hook and cod wars Burgunian ruler Philipp the Good gained control over Holland, Zeeland, Friesland and Hennegau. He won the war, mainly thanks to his victory at the battle of Brouwershaven, where he and his army of about 4000 defeated the English-Zeelandish force of about 3000. <br><br> It was not a battle the English and Zeelandish couldn't have won, though.
			</div>
			<h2>1493: Treaty of Senlis</h2>
			<p>
				Because Burgundy did not own parts of the Low Countries, those will also not be fought over in the Burgundian war of succession. That war therefore merely ends in the division of Burgundy proper. <br><br> This way neither Austria nor Spain ever get to take over the Low Countries.
			</p>
			<div class="popupbox">
				<i>Why?</i><br><br>
				The treaty of Senlis ended the Burgundian war of succession. <br><br> Austria and Spain, as posessions of the house of Habsburg, inherited parts of the Low Countries in the real timeline. <br><br> This event contributes to the alternate timeline by explaining its continuity.
			</div>
			<h2>1559: Last Italian War</h2>
			<p>
				In the Last Italian War the Habsburg allies are less depedent on Spain's participation in the war. The Holy Roman Empire therefore establishes more strongly centralized structures, to increase its military capabilities. <br><br> The war ended with France gaining few territories in Catalonia, while further areas of Northern Italy are integrated into the Holy Roman Empire. Spain continus its rule over Southern Italy and France must relinquish its Italian claims.
			</p>
			<div class="popupbox">
				<i>Why?</i><br><br>
				In the Italian war of 1551-1559, the so called "Last Italian War", the noble houses of Habsburg and Valois fought for hegemony over Italy. The Habsburgs owned the titles of Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire and King of Spain. The Low Countries* and Southern Italy were part of Spain. <br><br> The war went very similar to its version in the real timeline, but in this alternate timeline provides the Holy Roman Empire with a reason to implement greater centralization. <br><br> *not in the alternate timeline

			<h1>Setup</h1>
			<p>
				Every player gets an airship token and six score indicators. All players draw a random character card. They then place their score indicators on the resouces chart, depending on the amounts of the resources they gain at the start. Those amounts are represented by the colored boxes on the character cards. The players then place their airship tokens onto the place written on their character card.
				<br><br>				
				<i>
					Alternatively, all players can start at any place of their choice with eight funds, eight lifting gas, and two of all other resources.
