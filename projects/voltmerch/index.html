        <p>
            In late 2020 I began investigating the manner in which Volt Europa, the political movement I am part of, works with merchandise, finding the European-level effort for it currently in abeyance.
            Because I wanted to help improve that situation, I asked the movement's general secretary to support me managing a new merchandise effort for Volt Europa. That was accepted and so I became Volt's "Merchandise Lead".<br>
            <br>
            I researched how the pre-existing shop operated and what other experiences Volt members had managing the production, sale or distribution of merchandise products. Then I made a plan to overhaul the webshop interface, for the execution of which I then got the Tech team involved.<br>
            <br>
            After upgrading the shop's interface together with the tech team and making it accessible on <a href="https://voltshop.org/">https://voltshop.org/</a>, I assembled a group of visual designers and people interested in said topic to provide input for product designs.<br>
            <br>
            Acknowledging their input and bringing in my own ideas, I then put up new print graphics, and eventually replaced and expanded the entire product assortment. This means that I upgraded the fidelity of the prior print designs, removed products incompatible with updated brand guidelines and added new ones as well.<br>
            <br>
            Working together with my team and the general secretary I learnt a lot about running a merchandise operation and essentials of business planning, which we used to assess further development targets.<br>
            <br>
            We intend to expand our merchandise effort even more, but focus more on sustainability in our supply chain in the future.
